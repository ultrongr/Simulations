#SolarSystem

A simulation of (currently) 3 planets of our solar system and the moon moving around the sun.

The values for the distances, radius, mass, initial velocity are all real values taken from https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/mercuryfact.html .
The bodies move around with the use of Newton's laws and dont have preset orbits.

The simulation allows you to:

- Move around by dragging (if not locked on a planet) and zoom.
- Lock on a Planet and follow its orbit.
- Change the apparent size of planets (for better observation).
- Change the time step of the simulation (the speed is x1000xtime_step of real time)
